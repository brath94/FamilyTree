 Problem Statement
 Our story is set in the planet of Lengaburu......in the distant, distant
 galaxy of Tara B. And our protagonists are King Shan, Queen Anga &
 their family.
 King Shan is the emperor of Lengaburu and has been ruling the
 planet for the last 350 years (they have long lives in Lengaburu, you
 see!). Let’s write some code to get to know the family.
 

Meet The Family
Write code to model out the King Shan family tree so that:
•
Given a ‘name’ and a ‘relationship’, you should output the people corresponding to the relationship in the order in
which they were added to the family tree. Assume the names of the family members are unique.
•
You should be able to add a child to any family in the tree through the mother.
Simple, right? But remember.. our evaluation is based not only on getting the right output, but on how you've written your code.
Relationships To Handle
There are many relations that could exist but at a minimum, your code needs to handle these relationships.
